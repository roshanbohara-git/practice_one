# Summary of Day 01

Today I installed git and Github into my system. I started learning about git from its official Document [Git](https://git-scm.com/doc). I spend around half an hour exploring it. And then I tried to learn it from Youtube and start watching video of [Chai Aur Code](https://youtu.be/q8EevlEpQ2A?si=v7UY7fRu4epMa7ey) and i start to push my code into the git but i face a problem.

A year ago, i had logged in my Github Account using my previous gmail accound but today i logged in my account using new gmail account. When pushing the file into git but i didn't able to push it into my git because i was trying to push my file into new account but the previous account denied to push it.
